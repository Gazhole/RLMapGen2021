# RLMapGen2021

The bare bones of a Roguelike game in Python using PyGame.

Run the engine.py if you want to try it out.

The map gen algorithm is really slow, need to fix that. It does include provision for prefab rooms mixed in with the proc gen ones though.

The rendering is done in PyGame so uses sprites. Currently working on auto-tiling and need to get a better FOV algorithm implemented.
